# joystick-plate
To control the rover, it was decided to make a Bluetooth connection, 
which is designed in the form of ordinary joysticks. To do this, a circuit board was drawn up, 
then all the tracks were placed, and then it was ordered in the JLCPCB service.

Components for creating a joystick board:
1) 2s protection board (https://aliexpress.ru/item/33062582527)
